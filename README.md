Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog

The standard API does not include file dialog to select files or directories. 
This library is a file dialog that currently supports file selection and creation. 
In the near future it will also support directory selection - This functionality was added by cirelli.mauricio and commited to trunk as FileDialogWithDirectories.java.
